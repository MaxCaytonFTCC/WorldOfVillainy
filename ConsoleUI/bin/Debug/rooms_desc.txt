A dark, damp cavern with a small pool of murky water.
A long ominous tunnel that leads into other tunnels that are marked with emblems.
A warm cavern that echoes the clanking of anvils.
A dark green and purple-striped tent with two amiable skeletons inside.
A deep pit where new recruits prove themselves in combat.
